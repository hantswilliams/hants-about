This retrospective cohort study examines the external validity of the Parsley Symptom Index (PSI), an electronic Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement (ePROM) instrument designed for tracking symptoms in patients with multiple chronic diseases. The research demonstrates the PSI's efficacy across diverse patient populations and validates its use as a telehealth assessment tool for ongoing symptom monitoring and treatment evaluation.
